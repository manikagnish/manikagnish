# Hi there, I'm Manik Agnish 👋  

I’m a software developer, indie hacker, and coffee enthusiast ☕. Over the past few years, I’ve worked in startups, freelanced, and now focus on building my own products.  

I mainly work with the **react stack**, creating web and mobile apps that are simple, scalable, and user-friendly.
