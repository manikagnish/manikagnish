# Hi there, I'm Manik Agnish 👋  

I’m a software developer, indie hacker, and coffee enthusiast ☕. Over the past few years, I’ve worked in startups, freelanced, and now focus on building my own projects.  

I mainly work with **React, Next.js, React Native, Node.js, and Express**, creating web and mobile apps that are simple, scalable, and user-friendly.
